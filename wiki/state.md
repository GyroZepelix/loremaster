## Maintenance policy

This file is compact processing state for resume, dedupe, lint, and ingest checkpoints. It is not append-only history.

Update this file when:

- Full or incremental ingest checkpoints change.
- Lint date or lint checkpoint state changes.
- Raw files, source batches, URL batches, specs, ADRs, or commit ranges are processed into durable wiki knowledge and need dedupe/resume tracking.

Do not add rows for every session, chat turn, verification command, routine implementation plan, routine wiki edit, log-only event, or codebase change that does not affect durable wiki knowledge.

For wiki maintenance rows, `Output pages` should name wiki pages. Install/bootstrap rows may summarize the broader installed payload.

- Update checkpoints only after affected wiki pages are processed.
- Keep raw sources separate from trusted wiki synthesis.
- Mark uncertain or unverified pages as stale in `wiki/index.md`.
